# stats220

This is my *repo* for **STATS 220**. 

A little about me:
1. Firstly, I am a Filipino who immigrated to NZ at 12 years old.
2. Secondly, I am a University of Auckland student.
3. Thirdly, you can either visit the [University Website](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/study/study-options.html/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7dm-BhCoARIsALFk4v9BPcTZ9AJPFtgcZVNg1OtnVA_FcwFDMDpLNDKOth7bEYGE6vUl4s0aAiuaEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) or you can read my other details below. 

- I am undertaking a degree in Science, majoring in Computer Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because I would like to know about how to manage data
- I am interested in learning about anything this course teaches. 

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://media1.tenor.com/m/ywhmfLpF2PIAAAAC/it-is-shower-time.gif)
